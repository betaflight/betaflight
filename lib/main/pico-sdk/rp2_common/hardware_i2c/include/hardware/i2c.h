 * \brief I2C Controller API
 *
 * The I2C bus is a two-wire serial interface, consisting of a serial data line SDA and a serial clock SCL. These wires carry
 * information between the devices connected to the bus. Each device is recognized by a unique 7-bit address and can operate as
 * either a “transmitter” or “receiver”, depending on the function of the device. Devices can also be considered as masters or
 * slaves when performing data transfers. A master is a device that initiates a data transfer on the bus and generates the
 * clock signals to permit that transfer. The first byte in the data transfer always contains the 7-bit address and
 * a read/write bit in the LSB position. This API takes care of toggling the read/write bit. After this, any device addressed
 * is considered a slave. 
 *
 * This API allows the controller to be set up as a master or a slave using the \ref i2c_set_slave_mode function.
 *
 * The external pins of each controller are connected to GPIO pins as defined in the GPIO muxing table in the datasheet. The muxing options
 * give some IO flexibility, but each controller external pin should be connected to only one GPIO.
 *
 * Note that the controller does NOT support High speed mode or Ultra-fast speed mode, the fastest operation being fast mode plus
 * at up to 1000Kb/s.
 *
 * See the datasheet for more information on the I2C controller and its usage.
