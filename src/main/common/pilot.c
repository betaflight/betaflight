/*
 * Note: this code is very early code that justs gets basic information on the screen.
 *
 * This code is currently dependent on the max7465 chip but that is NOT the final goal.  Display driver abstraction is required.
 * The idea is that basic textual information should be able to be displayed by all OSD video hardware and all hardware layers should
 * translate an in-memory character buffer to the display as required.  In the case of the max7456 chip we will just copy the in-memory display
 * buffer to the max7456 character memory.
 *
 * Later on when the code is more mature support can be added for non-character based display drivers.
