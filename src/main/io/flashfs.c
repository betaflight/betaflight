/**
 * This provides a stream interface to a flash chip if one is present.
 *
 * On statup, call flashfsInit() after initialising the flash chip in order to init the filesystem. This will
 * result in the file pointer being pointed at the first free block found, or at the end of the device if the
 * flash chip is full.
 *
 * Note that bits can only be set to 0 when writing, not back to 1 from 0. You must erase sectors in order
 * to bring bits back to 1 again.
 *
 * In future, we can add support for multiple different flash chips by adding a flash device driver vtable
 * and make calls through that, at the moment flashfs just calls m25p16_* routines explicitly.
