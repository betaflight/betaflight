/**
 * This is a FAT16/FAT32 filesystem for SD cards which uses asynchronous operations: The caller need never wait
 * for the SD card to be ready.
 *
 * On top of the regular FAT32 concepts, we add the idea of a "super cluster". Given one FAT sector, a super cluster is
 * the series of clusters which corresponds to all of the cluster entries in that FAT sector. If files are allocated
 * on super-cluster boundaries, they will have FAT sectors which are dedicated to them and independent of all other
 * files.
 *
 * We can pre-allocate a "freefile" which is a file on disk made up of contiguous superclusters. Then when we want
 * to allocate a file on disk, we can carve it out of the freefile, and know that the clusters will be contiguous
 * without needing to read the FAT at all (the freefile's FAT is completely determined from its start cluster and file
 * size, which we get from the directory entry). This allows for extremely fast append-only logging.
