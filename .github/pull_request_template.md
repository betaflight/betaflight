## Important considerations when opening a pull request:

1.) Pull requests will only be accepted if they are opened against the `master` branch. Pull requests opened against other branches without prior consent from the maintainers will be closed;

2.) Please follow the coding style guidlines: https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/blob/master/docs/development/CodingStyle.md

3.) If your pull request is a fix for one or more issues that are open in GitHub, add a comment to your pull request, and add the issue numbers of the issues that are fixed in the form `Fixes #<issue number>`. This will cause the issues to be closed when the pull request is merged;

4.) Remove this Text :).
