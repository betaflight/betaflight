Betaflight is flight controller software (firmware) used to fly multi-rotor craft and fixed wing craft.

This fork differs from Baseflight and Cleanflight in that it focuses on flight performance, leading-edge feature additions, and wide target support.

## Features

Betaflight has the following features:

* Multi-color RGB LED strip support (each LED can be a different color using variable length WS2811 Addressable RGB strips - use for Orientation Indicators, Low Battery Warning, Flight Mode Status, Initialization Troubleshooting, etc)
* DShot (150, 300, 600 and 1200), Multishot, and Oneshot (125 and 42) motor protocol support
* Blackbox flight recorder logging (to onboard flash or external microSD card where equipped)
* Support for targets that use the STM32 F7, F4, F3 and F1 processors
* PWM, PPM, and Serial (SBus, SumH, SumD, Spektrum 1024/2048, XBus, etc) RX connection with failsafe detection
* Multiple telemetry protocols (CSRF, FrSky, HoTT smart-port, MSP, etc)
* RSSI via ADC - Uses ADC to read PWM RSSI signals, tested with FrSky D4R-II, X8R, X4R-SB, & XSR
* OSD support & configuration without needing third-party OSD software/firmware/comm devices
* OLED Displays - Display information on: Battery voltage/current/mAh, profile, rate profile, mode, version, sensors, etc
* In-flight manual PID tuning and rate adjustment
* Rate profiles and in-flight selection of them
* Configurable serial ports for Serial RX, Telemetry, ESC telemetry, MSP, GPS, OSD, Sonar, etc - Use most devices on any port, softserial included
* VTX support for Unify Pro and IRC Tramp
* and MUCH, MUCH more.

## Installation & Documentation

## IRC Support and Developers Channel

There's a dedicated Slack chat channel here:

http://www.betaflight.tk/

Etiquette: Don't ask to ask and please wait around long enough for a reply - sometimes people are out flying, asleep or at work and can't answer immediately.

## Configuration Tool

To configure Betaflight you should use the Betaflight-configurator GUI tool (Windows/OSX/Linux) that can be found here:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betaflight-configurator/kdaghagfopacdngbohiknlhcocjccjao

The source for it is here:

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged.  You can contribute in many ways:

* Documentation updates and corrections.
* How-To guides - received help? Help others!
* Bug reporting & fixes.
* New feature ideas & suggestions.

The best place to start is the IRC channel on gitter (see above), drop in, say hi. Next place is the github issue tracker:
